            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <h3>Ryan Remer</h3>
            <p>
                I am a college student at BYU-Provo. I am on my second year of computer science and loving it.
                I love building, designing, problem solving, and abstract ideas/concepts. I am very extroverted, and enjoy
                interacting and being with other people. If you ever get to meet me, you will find an enjoyably strange
                friend.
            </p>
            <h3>Dallin Frank</h3>
            <p>
                Whatever you want here Dallin.

            <h3>What is ____(Title)</h3>
            <p>
                This website was made with the intention of being a hub of information about the latest or greatest gadgets of
                all time. Click the "Shop" tab to being browsing the different items that we have deamed worthy of this site.
                Our goal is to provide a one stop website for entertainment.
            </p>
            <h3>The Inspiration</h3>
            <p>
                We decided to make this site for all the nerdy people that we know, there is just something entertaining about
                scrolling through pictures and lists of items that we all secretly (or openly) want. We made this site as another 
                source of entertainment, and a source of ideas for anyone to see. We hope that you enjoy our website and 
                also find whatever you're looking for!
            </p>
